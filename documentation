The bankers algorithm is a resource allocator algorithm that avoids deadlock. Uses s-state check. Has 2d arrays called allocation and max that are provided. Need is made of maximum - allocation. Safety algorithm has finish array returning true or false depending on status of the i'th process. Conditions are that finish[i] = false and need[i] <= work. Work = Work + allocation[i]. Finish[i] = true.
